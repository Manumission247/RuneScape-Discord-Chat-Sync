# RuneScape-Discord Chat Sync

A RuneScape Companion and Discord bot that synchronizes a RuneScape
Friends/Clan Chat with Discord chat.

RuneScape-Discord Chat Sync is a bot written in JavaScript that uses
[Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) to simulate a user
using the [RuneScape Companion](http://runescape.com/companion/comapp.ws)
web app to chat in the Friends/Clan Chat (it's easily configurable). When it
reads a message in the RuneScape chat it outputs it to the Discord chat using
[discord.js](https://discord.js.org), and when it reads a message in the
Discord chat it outputs it in the RuneScape chat, keeping the two chats synced.

This bot can be useful for users who want to continue a RuneScape conversation
without playing the game, people who want to make sure they don't miss part of
a conversation, or to keep chat logs.

Please note that Jagex has discontinued the RuneScape Companion app, thus
rendering this bot useless. I may remake the app under a new system, hopefully
I won't have to run an entire instance of the game client just to chat.
We'll see!

It is officially hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/aeramos/RuneScape-Discord-Chat-Sync).

## HOW TO USE
1. Download the repository. This can be done by downloading the `.zip`, but I
recommend using git so that you may easily receive updates.

2. Configure the bot.
    * Personalize the entries in `config.json.example`.

    * Rename `config.json.example` to `config.json`.

3. Run the bot.
    * Navigate to the project directory.

    * In the terminal, run `npm install` to install all of the necessary node
    packages. When you want to update the packages, run `npm update` instead.

    * In the terminal, run `node main.js` to start the bot using your
    configuration.

## FAQ
* Since the bot is licensed under the
[GNU AGPL-3.0+](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html), do I have to
distribute source code to people who use it when I run it?
    * Yes. All users of the bot **must** be able to get a copy of the source
    code. The license states that:

    > "If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
    network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get
    its source."

    > "Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
    Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting
    with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such
    interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your
    version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network
    server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of
    facilitating copying of software."

    The bot currently does this to what I consider a satisfactory level: it has
    commands that tell the user the name of the project and how to get the
    source code and license information. It also tells the user how to get help
    in the Discord activity field.

    More information can be found in the COPYING file. Please refer to it for
    any licensing issues and in the event of a contradiction between the text
    in the README and the text in COPYING, refer to the text in COPYING.

* Will I be banned from RuneScape for using this bot?
    * I **very** highly doubt it. First off, I don't think that Jagex's antiban
    applies to the RuneScape Companion since not much can be done from there.
    I have run this bot for days straight without any problems. If the bot does
    get banned, only the bot should get banned. I highly doubt that Jagex would
    ban anyone else (the host or anyone in the clan/friends chat). So rest
    assured, there is almost no risk from using this bot in your chat.
